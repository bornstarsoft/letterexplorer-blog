When you think of esports, titles like fast-paced shooters and intricate MOBAs likely come to mind. However, the recent showcase of Blue Prince at the Summer Games Done Quick (SGDQ) event has proven that even a single-player puzzle game can captivate audiences in a competitive format. The speedrunning community has ingeniously transformed this brainy game into a nail-biting spectator sport, demonstrating that the essence of competition can thrive in unexpected genres.

During SGDQ, competitors Randringtail and BobbyBurm engaged in a B Quest Bingo race, where they raced against the clock to complete objectives on a bingo board derived from Blue Princes layout. This innovative format not only highlighted the game's complexity but also showcased the players' ability to adapt and strategize under pressure. The excitement in the live audience was palpable, fueled by engaging commentary that made the event feel like a high-stakes showdown.

Blue Prince is a game that demands players to master hundreds of nuances and secrets, and the speedrunning format adds an exhilarating layer of urgency. As we look ahead, it will be fascinating to see how other unconventional games might follow suit and carve out their own niches in the competitive gaming landscape. Could we witness a new wave of esports that challenges our perceptions of what competitive gaming can be?
