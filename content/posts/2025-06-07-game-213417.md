The gaming world is buzzing with excitement over the upcoming release of **Pocket Boss**, a unique puzzle game that cleverly intertwines remote work dynamics with corporate data manipulation. Announced during the Day of the Devs showcase at Summer Game Fest, this game invites players to step into the shoes of an employee navigating the often absurd demands of a relentless boss—all from the confines of a chat window.

What sets Pocket Boss apart is its engaging mini-games that spring to life when players are tasked with altering data to boost profits or eliminate competition. Imagine flinging a competitor's market share off the screen or maneuvering through a chaotic stock market representation without crashing. This innovative gameplay feels reminiscent of the beloved WarioWare franchise, but with a corporate twist that resonates with today’s work-from-home culture.

Developed by Playables, the studio known for its creative titles like *Time Flies* and the interactive cartoon *KIDS*, Pocket Boss promises to deliver a fresh take on the puzzle genre. While we await a release date, the anticipation is palpable. Will this game redefine how we view corporate challenges through a playful lens? Only time will tell!
