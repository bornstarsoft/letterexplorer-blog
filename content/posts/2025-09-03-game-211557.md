Nintendo has just announced that Forsaken 64 will be the next addition to its Nintendo Switch Online library, marking a significant milestone as the 40th Nintendo 64 game to be released in the West. This first-person shooter, originally published by Acclaim in 1998, offers a unique gameplay experience that stands out from other titles of its time, thanks to its zero-gravity mechanics and labyrinthine levels filled with robotic foes.

What makes Forsaken 64 particularly interesting is its availability exclusively through the Mature-rated version of the Nintendo 64 app, ensuring that mature content is kept separate from the standard offerings. This move reflects Nintendo's commitment to providing a tailored gaming experience for different audiences, while also reviving classic titles that may have been overlooked in the past.

As we look forward to the release on September 4, its exciting to think about how Forsaken 64 will resonate with both nostalgic players and a new generation of gamers. Will this retro revival spark a renewed interest in other classic titles? Only time will tell.
