In a remarkable achievement for Rockstar Games, Red Dead Redemption 2 has officially surpassed Mario Kart 8 to become the fourth best-selling video game of all time, with over 79 million units sold. This milestone not only highlights the game's enduring popularity but also underscores Rockstar's ability to create titles that resonate with players long after their initial release.

Previously, Mario Kart 8 held the fourth position with 78 million units sold, a feat that seemed insurmountable. However, recent reports from Take-Two Interactive's investor earnings call revealed that Red Dead Redemption 2's sales continue to climb, solidifying its place in gaming history. As we look ahead, it will be interesting to see how this beloved title continues to perform, especially with ongoing sales trends indicating its strong presence in the market.

With anticipation building for Grand Theft Auto VI, one has to wonder: will Red Dead Redemption 2 maintain its momentum, or will it eventually be overshadowed by its successor?
