If you're a fan of indie horror games, now is the perfect time to grab a copy of Haus Of Irndrous for free on Steam! Developed by Yxtopia Studios, this atmospheric horror puzzle game is currently available at no cost until July 19, 2025. After that date, it will transition to a paid model, making this a limited-time opportunity for players to experience its chilling first chapter, Traces Of The Soul.

Originally launched in early access in August 2024, Haus Of Irndrous was designed to be an episodic experience, with the first chapter offered for free and subsequent episodes planned as paid DLC. However, Yxtopia Studios has recently announced a shift in their business model, citing the need for funding future chapters and server support as key reasons for the change. This move is not uncommon in the gaming industry, as seen with other titles that have made similar transitions.

As the game continues to evolve, players can expect updates that enhance gameplay, including improvements to enemy AI and performance optimizations. With the impending price tag of $1.99, now is the time to dive into the haunting world of Haus Of Irndrous. Will you take the plunge before it's too late?
