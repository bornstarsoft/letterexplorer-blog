Amazon Games has officially announced that its MMO, New World: Aeternum, will be going offline permanently on January 31, 2027. This announcement comes after the game was pulled from storefronts, including Steam and the Xbox store, marking a significant shift in Amazon's gaming strategy as they move away from MMO development. Players will still have access to the game they purchased until the servers shut down, but no new content will be released following the Nighthaven seasonal update.

In a heartfelt message to the community, Amazon Games expressed gratitude for the players' dedication and passion, stating, "Together we built something special." The company aims to give New World a memorable sendoff, celebrating the journey players have shared in the world of Aeternum. As the final year approaches, fans are left to reflect on their experiences and the impact of this unique adventure.

As we look forward to the last year of New World, it raises questions about the future of MMOs and how communities will adapt to the changing landscape of online gaming. What will be the next big adventure for players after Aeternum?
