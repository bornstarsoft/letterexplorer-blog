The Tokyo Monorail is set to launch an exciting real-world puzzle game in collaboration with the beloved Little Twin Stars, running from November 14, 2025, to February 28, 2026. This event promises to engage participants in a unique adventure where they will decode ciphers and explore the scenic routes of Tokyo Monorail, making it a perfect blend of entertainment and exploration for both locals and tourists.

Participants can choose between two routes: the Kiki Route from Hamamatsucho Station and the Lala Route from Haneda Airport Terminal 2 Station. Designed with beginners in mind, the puzzle-solving experience is accessible and fun, featuring a kit that includes a drawstring pouch, puzzle booklet, and exclusive tenant discount coupons. The first 1,000 participants will even receive a special ballpoint pen charm, adding an extra incentive to join this whimsical journey.

As the event coincides with the 50th anniversary of Little Twin Stars, theres also a commemorative photo spot at Haneda Airport Terminal 3 Station, making it a delightful destination for fans and families alike. With such engaging activities, this event not only promotes the use of public transport but also encourages a sense of community and nostalgia. Will you be among the puzzle solvers this winter?
