This dual celebration highlights Sega's commitment to honoring its diverse portfolio of games, ensuring that franchises like Puyo Puyo receive the recognition they deserve.

Originally launched in 1991, Puyo Puyo has evolved from its roots on the Famicon Disk System to become a staple in the puzzle genre, captivating audiences with its unique gameplay and charming aesthetics.
