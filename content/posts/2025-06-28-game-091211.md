The upcoming remaster of Final Fantasy Tactics, titled The Ivalice Chronicles, promises to enhance the original experience while making significant tweaks to its script. Yasumi Matsuno, the returning writer, emphasizes that these adjustments are not influenced by modern sensibilities or current events, but rather aim to present the beloved 1997 classic in a fresh format. This approach highlights the importance of maintaining the essence of the original game while adapting it for a new generation of players.

Matsuno elaborates on the differences between written and spoken dialogue, noting that the new voice acting necessitated a shift to a “listening-first” approach. This means that while the script has been revised for clarity and performance, it still retains the charm and character of the original. For fans who prefer the classic experience, the game will also offer a version that combines the graphics and gameplay of the original with the acclaimed War of the Lions translation.

As we anticipate the release of The Ivalice Chronicles on September 30th, it’s clear that the developers are walking a fine line between innovation and nostalgia. Will these changes resonate with long-time fans, or will they prefer the unaltered classic? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: the legacy of Final Fantasy Tactics continues to evolve.
