After two decades of anticipation, the legendary game "Infinity" is finally set to release on the Game Boy Color in Q4 of 2025. This tactical RPG, originally developed by Affinix Software between 1999 and 2001, has captivated retro gaming enthusiasts since its initial cancellation in 2002. With its unique strategic battle system and immersive storyline, Infinity promises to be a standout title for the nostalgic gaming community.

The game tells the epic tale of a nameless evil threatening to plunge two rival nations into war, with a disgraced knight at the center of the conflict. Players can expect a richly detailed world featuring over 30 explorable areas, 5 playable characters, and more than 100 items, all presented in stunning 8-bit graphics. The excitement surrounding its revival, especially after a successful crowdfunding campaign led by Incube8 Games, highlights the enduring love for retro titles and the potential for forgotten gems to be reborn.

Infinity is available for pre-order now, with options for standard, digital, and collector's editions, complete with exclusive merchandise. As we look forward to its release, one can't help but wonder: will Infinity redefine the landscape of retro gaming once again?
