Battlefield 6 is set to enhance player experience with significant tweaks to XP earning and gadget unlocking. In a recent community update, Battlefield Studios announced that players will see a 10% increase in XP earned from matches and a whopping 40% boost from daily bonuses. This means players will progress through the ranks much faster, making the game feel more rewarding.

Additionally, the studio is reducing the XP required to unlock the first 20 attachment ranks, allowing players to earn useful attachments nearly twice as quickly. This change addresses long-standing player frustrations regarding leveling up and unlocking essential gameplay content. Assignments that previously required higher career ranks will now be accessible sooner, further smoothing the progression experience.

As Battlefield Studios continues to refine the game, players can look forward to a more engaging and satisfying journey through their gaming milestones. What other changes would you like to see implemented in future updates?
