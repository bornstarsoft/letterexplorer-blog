In a surprising revelation, indie developer Petter Malmehed has linked the decline of his puzzle game, After Hours, on Steam to a lack of email communication skills among younger players. Since its release in 2018, the game has seen a steady drop in user reviews and completion rates, which Malmehed attributes to players struggling with the game's unique requirement to send real-life emails to progress. This insight raises questions about how modern communication habits are affecting gaming experiences.

Malmehed's findings highlight a broader trend: as digital communication evolves, essential skills like crafting a proper email may be fading among younger generations. With many players cramming their messages into subject lines, the game's mechanics are failing to engage them effectively. This situation not only impacts Malmehed's game but also serves as a wake-up call for developers to consider how their designs align with contemporary communication styles.

As we move forward, it will be interesting to see how developers adapt to these changing dynamics. Will we see more games that simplify communication, or will there be a resurgence in teaching these essential skills? The future of gaming may depend on it.
