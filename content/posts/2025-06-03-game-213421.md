In a bold move that highlights the lengths retailers will go to meet consumer demand, a Slovenian video game shop owner embarked on a 20-hour round trip to Italy to secure stock of the highly anticipated Nintendo Switch 2. With no official distribution channels in Slovenia, Konzolko's owner decided that driving to Italy was the best way to ensure his customers would have access to the new consoles on launch day.

The journey was not without its risks; the owner expressed concerns about potential theft and the dangers of the drive itself. Despite these worries, he managed to fill his car with "half a ton" of Switch 2 consoles, demonstrating a commitment to his customers that goes beyond mere business. With the console set to launch on June 5, he is optimistic that his stock will last through the summer, especially with additional deliveries expected.

As the gaming community eagerly awaits the arrival of the Switch 2, this story serves as a reminder of the passion and dedication that small retailers bring to the industry. Will this kind of grassroots effort become more common as gaming continues to evolve? Only time will tell.
