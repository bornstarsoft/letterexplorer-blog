Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is set to delight fans with the introduction of Pac-Man content this week, alongside a surprise free festival. From January 7 to January 11, players can participate in the in-game Pac-Man Festival, which will be accessible to everyone, including those who do not own the Pac-Man Pack. This festival is a fantastic opportunity for gamers to engage with the vibrant world of Sonic Racing while enjoying the nostalgic charm of Pac-Man.

The Pac-Man Pack, available for owners of the Season Pass and Digital Deluxe edition, features new racers, a unique machine, and an exciting course. This addition follows other popular collaborations, including SpongeBob SquarePants and Minecraft-themed content. Sega has also hinted at more paid content coming this year, featuring beloved franchises like Mega Man and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

As Sonic Racing continues to expand its universe, the director promises even more surprises throughout the 2026 season. With regular free updates and a commitment to delivering engaging content, fans can look forward to an exciting year ahead.
