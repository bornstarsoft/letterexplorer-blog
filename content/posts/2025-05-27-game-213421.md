Indie developer Pixel Maniacs is making waves with their upcoming title, **ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard**, boldly claiming, "Valve never made a Portal 2 sequel. So we did." This audacious comparison to the beloved Portal series sets high expectations for a game that aims to capture the essence of innovative puzzle-solving while introducing its own unique mechanics. With a free demo available on Steam, players can get a taste of this intriguing FPS puzzle experience.

While the game draws inspiration from Portal's testing environments, the gameplay mechanics seem to align more closely with titles like Qube and Qube 2, focusing on color-based puzzles rather than the iconic portals. Players will utilize a special gun to manipulate the environment by changing object colors, which adds a fresh twist to the puzzle genre. Given that the original ChromaGun received 'Mostly Positive' reviews, there's a lot of potential for this sequel to carve out its own niche in the gaming landscape.

As we look forward to the release of ChromaGun 2, it raises an interesting question: can indie developers successfully fill the void left by major studios when it comes to beloved franchises? With creativity and innovation at the forefront, it seems the future of puzzle gaming is in good hands.
