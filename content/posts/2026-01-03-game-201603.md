As Xbox Game Pass continues to evolve, players need to stay informed about the games that are leaving the service. On January 16, 2026, titles like *Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn*, *Neon White*, *Road 96*, *The Ascent*, and *The Grinch: Christmas Adventures  Merry & Mischievous Edition* will be removed. This is a crucial moment for subscribers who may want to purchase these games at a discount before they disappear from the library.

Fortunately, Xbox offers a great opportunity for subscribers to save money. By purchasing these games before their removal, players can keep them in their digital library at a reduced price. This not only allows gamers to enjoy these titles beyond their Game Pass subscription but also ensures they dont miss out on some fantastic gaming experiences. What new titles will replace these games, and how will they enhance the Xbox Game Pass lineup? Only time will tell.
