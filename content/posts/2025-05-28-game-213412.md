Sony has unveiled the exciting lineup of PlayStation Plus Essential monthly games for June, and it's a mix of nostalgia and fresh experiences that will surely captivate gamers. Among the highlights is **Bomb Rush Cyberfunk**, a cel-shaded action-adventure platformer that pays homage to Sega's beloved **Jet Set Radio**. With a soundtrack featuring the iconic composer Hideki Naganuma, this title is poised to resonate with fans of the original while attracting a new generation of players.

In addition to Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, June's offerings include **NBA 2K 25**, the latest installment in the long-running basketball franchise, and the highly anticipated **Alone in the Dark**, a reboot of the classic survival horror series featuring Jodie Comer and David Harbour. Furthermore, players can also look forward to **Destiny 2: The Final Shape**, available from May 28, which adds to the excitement of this month's gaming experience.

As Sony shifts its focus towards PS5 titles, with plans to phase out PS4 games by January 2026, this monthâ€™s lineup serves as a reminder of the evolving landscape of gaming. With new titles and classic reboots, it's an exciting time to be a PlayStation Plus subscriber. What are you most looking forward to playing this June?
