Fans of Nintendo are buzzing with excitement after a recent trailer may have inadvertently revealed upcoming titles for the Nintendo Switch Online service. A blurred section of the video showcased several N64 games that have yet to be added to the platform, igniting speculation about fan-favorite titles like Donkey Kong 64 and Super Smash Bros. making their way to the service.

The discovery, first highlighted by user @ImakuniVT, suggests that the blurred images could represent cover art for these highly requested games. While its possible that this artwork is merely a placeholder, the excitement surrounding potential new additions to the Nintendo 64 catalog is palpable. Currently, the service boasts over 30 games, including classics like Banjo-Kazooie, but fans are eager for more.

As Nintendo continues to enhance its classic games library, the recent addition of GameCube titles alongside the Switch 2 launch has set a precedent for whats to come. With the gaming community eagerly awaiting official announcements, one cant help but wonder: which other beloved titles might join the Nintendo Switch Online lineup in the near future?
