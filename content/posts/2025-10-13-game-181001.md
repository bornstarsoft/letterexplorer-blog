In recent years, PC and console gaming have transformed from a niche hobby into a dominant cultural force, generating over 130 trillion won in annual sales worldwide. This resurgence is largely driven by advancements in high-end graphics and immersive gameplay experiences that mobile gaming simply cannot match. Notably, Korean game developers are stepping up to the plate, releasing titles aimed at the global market, such as the critically acclaimed "Stella Blade" and "P's False."

According to recent data, the combined market for PC and console games reached an impressive $95.1 billion last year, surpassing even mobile gaming. The popularity of these platforms is evident, with over 1 billion downloads recorded this year alone. Steam remains the leader in the PC gaming space, while consoles like PlayStation and Xbox continue to thrive, particularly with blockbuster titles dominating sales charts.

As we look ahead, the gaming landscape is set for further evolution with exciting new releases on the horizon. Will the momentum continue, and how will emerging technologies shape the future of gaming? The next few years promise to be thrilling for gamers and developers alike.
