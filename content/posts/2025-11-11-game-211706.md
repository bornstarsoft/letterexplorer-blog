In a surprising turn of events, the promising retro-futuristic adventure game, The Midnight Riders, has been canceled by NetEase, leading to the shutdown of Bad Brain Game Studios. This decision is particularly disheartening given the game's intriguing premise, which blends elements reminiscent of Stranger Things and classic 80s nostalgia. The studio's head, Sean Crooks, shared a sizzle reel in hopes of attracting potential investors, showcasing a world filled with mystery and adventure that many gamers were eager to explore.

The Midnight Riders follows a teenager named Josh as he investigates the mysterious disappearances of local children, navigating a vibrant yet eerie 1980s setting. The games unique blend of adventure and horror, complete with nightmarish creatures and nostalgic references, captured the imagination of many. Despite the cancellation, both Bad Brain and NetEase remain open to selling the IP, which leaves a glimmer of hope for fans who wish to see this project come to fruition.

As we reflect on this cancellation, it raises questions about the future of indie gaming and the importance of funding for innovative projects. Will we see The Midnight Riders rise from the ashes, or is this yet another lost opportunity in the gaming landscape? Only time will tell.
