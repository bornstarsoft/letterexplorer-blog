Long-lost NES puzzle game Xcavator, initially developed in 1991 by Chris Oberth, is making a remarkable comeback thanks to a collaboration between iam8bit and the Video Game History Foundation. This unreleased gem will be available as a fully polished cartridge edition, priced at $100, and will include a detailed manual that not only chronicles the games troubled past but also highlights Oberths career and the broader challenges of preserving 8-bit history.

The release of Xcavator is more than just a nostalgic trip down memory lane; it represents a significant effort to preserve gaming history. With profits supporting the Video Game History Foundations archival efforts, this initiative underscores the importance of maintaining our digital heritage. As we witness the revival of such forgotten titles, it raises an intriguing question: what other lost games are waiting to be rediscovered in the annals of gaming history?
