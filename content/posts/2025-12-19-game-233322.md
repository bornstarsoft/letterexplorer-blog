Gamirror Games is set to launch AiliA, a visually stunning mirror-based puzzle game, on January 9, 2026. Developed by IceToad Studio LLC, this 3D puzzle-adventure invites players to step into a world where reality intertwines with its mirrored counterpart. As Aria, a young girl on a quest to rescue her twin sister, players will navigate through intricate puzzles that challenge both spatial awareness and creative thinking.

The gameplay mechanics of AiliA are particularly intriguing, as players manipulate mirrors to reshape their environment and unlock new pathways. With over 100 meticulously crafted puzzles and seven distinct stages inspired by Eastern aesthetics, the game promises a rich exploration experience. For those who thrive on challenge, hidden levels add an extra layer of depth to the adventure.

As the release date approaches, a playable demo is already available on Steam, allowing eager gamers to get a taste of this unique experience. Will AiliA redefine how we perceive puzzle games?
