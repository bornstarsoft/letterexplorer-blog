Capcom has officially put to rest the speculation that its upcoming title, Pragmata, is a hidden revival of the beloved Mega Man franchise. Producer Naoto Oyama confirmed that Pragmata is a completely original game, despite fan theories linking its robotic sidekick, Diana, to the iconic Mega Man character. This revelation comes as a relief to many who have been eagerly awaiting new content from Capcom, especially in light of the long hiatus since the last Mega Man release.

While fans have drawn parallels between Pragmata's moonbase setting and the classic Mega Man themes of battling evil machines, Oyama's comments highlight Capcom's commitment to creating fresh experiences. The company has expressed its ongoing respect for the Mega Man series and is exploring ways to bring it back, but Pragmata stands as a unique entry in their portfolio. With its scheduled release now set for 2026, anticipation continues to build around this new IP.

As we look ahead, the question remains: what new adventures and challenges will Pragmata bring to gamers? With Capcom's strong track record, there's plenty of reason to be excited about this original title and its potential to carve out its own legacy in the gaming world.
