In a significant turn of events, Bad Brain Game Studios, a subsidiary of NetEase, has announced its impending shutdown due to unsuccessful efforts in securing a new partner for its project, Midnight Riders. This closure, set for November 17th, 2025, serves as a stark reminder of the challenges faced by game developers in todays competitive landscape. The studio, established in 2023 with talent from Ubisoft Toronto, now finds itself at a crossroads, highlighting the precarious nature of partnerships in the gaming industry.

As the gaming world evolves, the ability to adapt and secure reliable partnerships becomes increasingly crucial. Bad Brain's willingness to explore acquisition opportunities underscores the importance of collaboration in sustaining game development projects. With this closure, they join the ranks of other NetEase subsidiaries, like Fantastic Pixel Castle, which are also shutting down, raising questions about the company's future strategy and focus on its overseas studios.

As we reflect on this news, it prompts us to consider: what does the future hold for independent game studios in an environment where securing partnerships is becoming more challenging? Will we see a shift towards more sustainable models of collaboration in the gaming industry?
