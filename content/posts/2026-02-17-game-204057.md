Nintendo has officially launched its Virtual Boy app on Switch Online, bringing back a selection of games from one of its most infamous consoles. With seven titles available at launch, including classics like 3D Tetris and Virtual Boy Wario Land, players can now experience the nostalgia of the Virtual Boy era, albeit with a modern twist.

To access these games, players will need a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership, along with a physical Virtual Boy accessory, which can be purchased from the My Nintendo Store. The accessory replicates the original console and is priced at $100, while a more affordable cardboard viewer option is available for $25. As Nintendo continues to expand its library, fans can look forward to an additional nine games in the future, making this a significant revival of a once-forgotten gaming experience.

With only 22 games ever released for the Virtual Boy, this app offers players a chance to explore the majority of its library. As we look ahead, will this revival spark renewed interest in the Virtual Boy and its unique gaming style?
