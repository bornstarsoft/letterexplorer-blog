Rare has officially announced that paid custom servers will be introduced to Sea of Thieves in early 2026. This exciting development was revealed during the games first community direct, Custom Seas. Players will have the opportunity to explore private servers that come with exclusive tools, including a cinematic camera that has been used to create trailers for the game. While specific pricing details have yet to be disclosed, Rare has indicated that maintaining these servers will require a monthly fee due to the costs involved.

In addition to the custom servers, Rare is also revamping the games seasonal model. The upcoming seasons will be structured into three distinct phases, each lasting a month. The first month will focus on rejuvenating the sandbox experience, the second will highlight live events, and the third will emphasize community engagement. This strategic shift aims to reinvigorate player interest and enhance the overall gaming experience.

As Sea of Thieves continues to evolve, the introduction of paid custom servers and a refreshed seasonal model could significantly change how players interact with the game. Are you excited about these upcoming features, and how do you think they will impact the Sea of Thieves community?
