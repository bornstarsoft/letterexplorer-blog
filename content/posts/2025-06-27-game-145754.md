Capcom's upcoming game, Pragmata, is set to redefine the puzzle-shooter genre with its innovative gameplay mechanics. In a recent gameplay reveal, players got a glimpse of how they will navigate a futuristic lunar research station, combining puzzle-solving with intense shooting action. The unique mechanic of hacking robots through a puzzle mini-game while dodging enemy fire promises to deliver a thrilling experience that keeps players on their toes.

Originally announced in June 2020, Pragmata has faced several delays, now slated for release in 2026. The game features Hugh, a combat-ready spaceman, and his android companion Diana, who intriguingly resembles a human child. This dynamic duo is sure to engage players as they unravel the mysteries of a crisis-stricken lunar environment. Early impressions from media previews suggest that Pragmata is not only polished but also leaves players eager for more.

As we look forward to its release, the question remains: can Capcom maintain its impressive track record and deliver a compelling experience that lives up to the hype? Only time will tell, but the anticipation is certainly building.
