Nintendo Switch Online has just added three exciting titles to its SNES library, including the long-awaited international release of "Mario & Wario." This marks a significant moment for fans of retro gaming, as it is the first time this unique puzzle platformer has been made available outside of Japan since its original release on the Super Famicom.

"Mario & Wario," developed by Game Freak before their Pokmon fame, challenges players to guide Mario through 100 levels filled with obstacles, all while he is blinded by Warios antics. The games reliance on the Super Famicom Mouse made it a rarity in the West, but with the Switchs Joy-Con support, players can finally experience this hidden gem. Joining it are "Bubsy in Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind," a cult classic platformer, and "Fatal Fury Special," an enhanced fighting game that expands the roster and gameplay mechanics.

As Nintendo continues to breathe new life into its classic titles, it raises the question: what other forgotten gems might we see in the future? The expansion of the SNES library not only appeals to nostalgic gamers but also introduces a new generation to the rich history of Nintendo's gaming legacy.
