Ubisoft's CEO, Yves Guillemot, has confirmed that the company is actively developing multiple titles under the Assassin's Creed and Far Cry franchises. This announcement comes amidst significant restructuring within the company, which has raised concerns among employees and protest groups. Guillemot emphasized that these new projects will include both single-player and multiplayer experiences, aiming to expand the community that has already surpassed 30 million players for Assassin's Creed.

The restructuring at Ubisoft is part of a broader strategy to enhance creativity and efficiency within the organization. With the introduction of autonomous 'creative houses', the company is looking to streamline operations while navigating a highly competitive gaming landscape. Despite the challenges, Guillemot is committed to maintaining transparency and open dialogue with staff, recognizing the importance of addressing their concerns during this transformative period.

As Ubisoft moves forward with these ambitious projects, the gaming community eagerly anticipates what new adventures await in the beloved worlds of Assassin's Creed and Far Cry. Will these changes lead to a revitalized gaming experience for fans?
