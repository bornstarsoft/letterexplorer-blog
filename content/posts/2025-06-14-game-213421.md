In a bold move that has sent shockwaves through the gaming community, Microsoft has confirmed that Obsidian Entertainment's upcoming title, The Outer Worlds 2, will be the first Xbox game to launch at a staggering price of $80. This decision follows Nintendo's controversial pricing strategy with Mario Kart World, raising questions about the future of game pricing and consumer expectations in an industry already grappling with rising costs and inflation.

The Outer Worlds 2, set to release in 2025, continues the franchise's tradition of satirical storytelling, poking fun at corporate greed while ironically being positioned as a premium product. The game will not only be available in a standard edition but also in a Premium Edition for $100, which includes early access, additional content, and exclusive in-game items. This pricing strategy has sparked a wave of backlash from fans, many of whom took to social media and forums to express their disbelief and frustration, questioning whether the game can deliver enough value to justify its high price tag.

As the gaming landscape evolves, with major players like Microsoft and Nintendo setting new pricing precedents, it remains to be seen how consumers will respond. Will this trend lead to a reevaluation of what gamers are willing to pay, or will it ignite a backlash that could reshape the industry? Only time will tell if The Outer Worlds 2 will thrive or falter under the weight of its price point.
