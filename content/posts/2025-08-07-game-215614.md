MiHoYo has officially announced the end of support for the PS4 version of Genshin Impact, citing hardware limitations as the driving factor. Beginning September 10, 2025, the game will be removed from the PlayStation Store, marking a significant shift as the gaming landscape continues to evolve. This decision highlights the increasing demands of modern gaming and the need for players to adapt to newer platforms.

The phased approach to discontinuation includes the removal of in-game purchases by February 25, 2026, and the complete cessation of update support by April 8, 2026. Players will still be able to access their accounts and progress on PS5 and other platforms, but this transition serves as a reminder of the rapid pace of technological advancement in gaming. As the industry moves forward, how will players adapt to these changes, and what does this mean for the future of cross-platform gaming?
