Nintendo Switch Online is set to delight retro gaming fans with the addition of three classic Super NES titles in October 2025. The latest update brings Mario & Wario, Bubsy in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind, and Fatal Fury Special to the Nintendo Switch Online library, enhancing the nostalgic experience for players around the globe.

Among these titles, Mario & Wario stands out as a unique action puzzle game that originally launched in Japan in 1993. Players must navigate Mario, who is blinded by a bucket dropped by Wario, using a forest fairy's magic wand to create platforms and guide him to safety. Meanwhile, Bubsy the bobcat returns in his quest to recover stolen yarn in Bubsy in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind, a beloved action game from the same era. Finally, Fatal Fury Special introduces new characters and intense fighting mechanics, making it a must-play for fans of the genre.

As Nintendo continues to expand its classic game offerings, it raises the question: what other hidden gems from the past might we see on the platform in the future? Retro gaming enthusiasts surely have their fingers crossed for more surprises ahead!
